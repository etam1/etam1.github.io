The bubbles subtly change in size, adding to their lifelike motion, while layered, semi-transparent ellipses give each one a soft, glowing effect. Occasionally, new bubbles appear, keeping the display visually engaging and allowing users to feel immersed in a fluid, organic environment." link="https://editor.p5js.org/etam1/sketches/zfDKryQAF" />
